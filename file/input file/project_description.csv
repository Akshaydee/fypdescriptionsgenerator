In developing this app, among other things, it will be necessary to read data from files and write data to other files; plug your app into Java code; use graphics libraries.    Further details on the project:  Information retrieval (IR) is a process which aims to locate, for a given information need (expressed as a keyword query), relevant content (documents) from a document archive.     Researchers develop IR techniques. One way they can test how good their IR system is, is by taking a set of queries and seeing how good their retrieval technique is at finding the documents that answer the query. Statistical evaluation metrics tell them how good their technique is at answering the queries. Java code exists to calculate these statistics. In this project an app will be developed to link into this existing code to show the statistics and to help the researcher understand and process the statistics.

The website will need to support creation of an admin and user accounts. Users of the website should be able to read text and write queries for the text. The website will connect to a backend database to read data and store data.    ***   Further details on the topic of the project:  The website created in this project supports information retrieval (IR) evaluation by supporting the generation of IR datasets.     Information retrieval (IR) is a process which aims to locate, for a given information need (expressed as a keyword query), relevant content (documents) from a document archive.     One way that researchers can evaluate how good the information retrieval techniques that they develop are is by participating in an evaluation campaign which provides them with a set of health related queries and documents to search for relevant content in. These query sets are sometimes generated by having individuals read a scenario and enter the query that they would issue for the given scenario.     This project will generate a web based tool that supports generation of these query sets. Admin features for this tool will also be required.      ***",,,,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1 : Standard project,1 : There are no special requirements,1 : Does not require ethics approval,1,,1,,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,,0,1,0,

We can use these captured biometric response readings to understand individual's activities in different contexts or to understand their engagement with different situations. Website creation / app development projects are available in this space. These projects will create tools to process this data, or visualize this data. Backend projects which process this data to understand user activities are also available.     *** Further details on the projects:    Biometric response provides a measure of an individual's arousal levels or engagement with a life situation, e.g. a person's biometric response would be different when their football team scored the winning game of a match than when they lost a match. This biometric response can be measured using devices worn on one’s arm.       These biometric response measures can be used in combination with other devices to understand individuals activities or their engagement with activities. For example a diary  kept when wearing the device could provide insight into one's life. Or it is now possible to capture visual diaries of one’s daily life, using a device such as the SnapCam which can be clipped to one’s clothes and used to automatically capture multiple photos per minute.       Website / app development projects are available to: (1) provide a frontend to allow people explore these collections; (2) support the processing of data in these collections. Backend projects are available which will explore understanding individuals' activities from biometric response levels/readings.     Projects will involved, among other things: designing experiments, setting up experiment subjects with the biometric devices and any other devices used, collecting and organising experiment data, analysing data and reporting the results of the experiments.      An interest in search technologies and information retrieval is desirable. As is interest in working with new technologies (see above project description).   ***    [There are 3 individual projects in this space available.
