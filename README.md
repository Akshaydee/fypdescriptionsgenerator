# Overview
This is my final year project (FYP) in Maynooth University.

This project involves generating two apps that helps with the automation of part of the final year project (FYP) management process. Specifically:
- <strong>FYP Grading Report Generator</strong>
  - the automatic analysis and combination of studentsâ€™ grades, from Excel files, into a well-formatted PDF document
- <strong>FYP Descriptions Generator</strong>
  - the automatic generation of PDF documents containing final year project descriptions from Excel files

To sum up, both of the two sub projects are about fetching data from Excel files and exporting well-formatted PDF with the data.

This project is the <strong>FYP Descriptions Generator</strong> project.

The output PDF: [Project_Descriptions_for_Internal_Check_2022.pdf](https://github.com/longporo/fypdescriptionsgenerator/blob/45ae79587b6b1ac31ab56b0d0f73a0b583ed4143/file/output%20file/Project_Descriptions_for_Internal_Check_2022.pdf) and [Project_Descriptions_for_Students_2022.pdf](https://github.com/longporo/fypdescriptionsgenerator/blob/45ae79587b6b1ac31ab56b0d0f73a0b583ed4143/file/output%20file/Project_Descriptions_for_Students_2022.pdf).
